## Required GitLab Access

During the Workshop we will use [Duke's Gitlab](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu) implementation.  To complete the hands-on portion of the workshop, you **must log-in, in advance** of the workshop to ensure you have NetID access.  If you do not have access [contact OIT](https://oit.duke.edu/help) and resolve the issue in advance of the workshop.

## Genearte SSH keys Generated in Advance of the workshop

I recommend generating your SSH keys in advance of the workshop.  To do so, you should have already installed git to your laptop.  Then follow these instructions for generating the keys.  We will cover this in class but [I recommend following the steps on *Generating a new SSH key pair*](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair) in advance of the workshop.
