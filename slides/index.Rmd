## Why RStudio?

- **Reproducibility** is a Top Priority

- Seamless operation with [Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

- **Git for Version Control**

    - Git can be a pain to configure but works well in the background
    - Leapfrog beyond the barrier of a painful configuration

- **RStudio orchestrates Git**

    - Alternative:  GitKracken (if you have the [GitHub Student](https://education.github.com/pack) Pack)
    - Alternative:  [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (defaults with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/))


- **Social Coding**

    - GitHub (especially with Student Pack)
    - GitLab (OIT instance) 
    - Bitbucket.org or GitLab.com

## Broman: Everything with a script

The most basic aspect of **reproducible research** is that **everything you do** (convert data files, clean data, analyze data) should be **accomplished via code.** 

*Pointing and clicking, and copy-paste, are not reproducible.*

Versioning can be used 

- as a kind of **breadcrumb system** that helps track the **research process/workflow**

- Using version control, one can **easily "roll back"** to an earlier moment in the research workflow.

- Leave a documented 

    - **trail of where you've been**
    - how you got there
    - generated as you go

### Source Code Mangement
By this I simply mean **version control on a personal level**.  Once can "branch" stages of research and merge successful operations.  In this way it becomes easier to keep track of the process and the progress.

### Tracking changes in **any file set**

**Git** can be used to **track any files**.

## Social **git Repositories**

???

- **Social Coding** = collaboration

- Introduce the idea of **LOCKSS**: "Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe."  Now you have copies in the cloud and on local workstations.  You can work in various locations on various computers (e.g. at home and at work) without worrying about version or file location.  (This assumes you've installed **multiple keys**)

- Share **trackable progress** of your reproducible activity

    - even if you are only **sharing with yourself**

???

- Duke has it's own instance of GitLab

Duke's GitLab instance means 

- FREE. ...  you don't have to pay for private repos

- Can synchronize to larger networks (e.g. GitHub) at any point.



I mostly use Duke's GitLab for private work and development.  But I like my public presence at GitHub.  Both can be accessed via RStudio.

Public Hubs are defined as GitHub, BitBucket, and the public GitLab.

R Markdown -- when combined with various R packages -- makes R a flexible report generation system.  Thus R Notebooks become "literate code" where reports are an outcome of analysis.  If analysis changes at "run-time" reports can change as integrated parts of the whole.  

Notably:  **You Don't have to be a coder** to benefit from Version Control and R Markdown.  The two method/features can be used to compose all of your reporting needs, including MS Word, PDF, LaTex, WebPages, WebSites, Slides, e-books, etc.

I want to emphasize that *R* and *Git* are ideal for *reproducible research*.  However, the added factor of **R Markdown** -- when combined with various R packages -- makes R a flexible report generation system, arguably more *open* and *reproducible* than other proprietary collaborations systems.
