The instructions below are based on those found at Duke's GitLab.  If the instructions below are not clear you should consult the more complete GitHub instructions to [generate and add an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)  

1. To begin, open the **Terminal** *in RStudio*.  If you're using the latest version of RStudio, the *Terminal* is a tab in the console quadrant (typically the bottom-left)

    - In RStudio: Menubar `Tools > Terminal > New Terminal`

2. Determine if you already have an SSH key pair.  In the *Termnal* tab, type:  `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    
    - If you see a string starting with `ssh-rsa` you already have an SSH key pair and can simply copy that key (Step 5)
        
    - If you get some kind of error, you'll have to generate a key in the next step
        
1. In the *Terminal* tab, type:  `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your.email@example.com" -b 4096`

    - I recommend using your Duke Email address but it must be the address you used to create your GitHub account
    
1. You will be prompted to input a file path.  i.e. the location where you'll save your SSH key pair.

    - If you don't already have an SSH key pair use the suggested path by pressing enter
    
     - After setting the file path you will be prompted to input a password.  This will secure your SSH key pair. It is a best practice to use a password for an SSH key pair, but it is not required.  You can skip creating a password by pressing enter

        - **Note**:  If you want to change the password of your SSH key pair, you can use `ssh-keygen -p <keyname>`  
    
1. Copy the public SSH key to the clipboard buffer

    - In the *Termnal* tab, type the appropriate code below:
        - **macOS**:  `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy`
        - **Windows**:  `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip`
    
1. The final step is to add your public SSH key to GitHub.

    - Navigate to the *SSH and GPG keys* section of your GitHub *Settings*.  Click the green **New SSH key** button and paste your key in the *Key* section.  Give the key a relevant *Title*  Use an identifiable title like *Work Laptop - Windows 7* or *Home MacBook Pro 15.*
    
    - If you manually copied your public SSH key make sure you copied the entire key starting with `ssh-rsa` and ending with your email.
    
## Additional legacy instructions

I spent a couple of years promoting the SSH credentials method.  That was before the existence of the [usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).  As a result of `usethis` I've change the workshop procedures when teaching Git version control.  Nonetheless, I wanted to keep the [old SSH init/clone/pull/push procdures](ssh_handson.html) around for people who may have come to rely on the SSH credentials method I taught previously.  In reality, there's not much difference but I don't want to shock anyone so I'll keep the previous procedures around for a few semesters.  

## Old SSH Instructions

The following link shows you how to create your repository at GitHub and then pull the initial repository down to your local workstation.
