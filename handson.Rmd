### Generate SSH Keys 

This must be done on each workstation you use to *push*.  

- https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/help/ssh/README

This step was covered in the [Outline Section](outline.html#generate_ssh_keys_in_advance_of_the_workshop)

## Make a Repository
1. Duke's GitLab -- <a href="https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu" target="_blank">https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu</a>
1. Duke Shibboleth Login
1. New Project

    - ![](images/new_gitlab_project_button.png)
    
1. Add a project name:  

    - ![](images/project_name.png) -- `test-one` 
    - ![](images/create_project.png) -- Create Project
    - On the Next Page, notice the section below *Command line instructions*.  That information could come in handy.  For future repositories, you may want to make a note of those *Git* commands.  
    
1. Make a README file (Open in a New Tab, click the README link)

    1. ![](images/readme.png)
    1. `Commit changes`
    
1. Make a license file (Open in a New Tab, click the LICENSE link) 

    1. ![](images/license.png)click *Appply a license format* > choose *MIT* (or paste in a Creative Commons License) 
    1. `Commit changes`  
    
1. Make a .gitignore file (Open in a New Tab, click the .gitignore link)

    1. click *Apply a .gitignore format* 
    
        - choose *R* 
        
    1. `Commit changes`  
    
1. Congratulations.  You've just created your first GitLab repository.  Click *test-one* in the top-right of your screen and you'll see the three files you just created.

## Clone

Using RStudio, clone your repository.  This will pull down the whole repo including the three files you just created.
    
### Bring the repo down locally via RStudio

	1. Copy GitLab URL to clipboard 
	
	    - ![](images/copy.png) -- Copy the repo URL
	    - repo `https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/<<your-NetID>>/test-one`, copyURL to clipboard (click icon)
	    
	1. Launch RStudio and create a *New Project...*
	
	    1. Menubar:  *File > New Project...* > Version Control > Git > paste the URL from the step above into *Repository URL:* <br>
	    
	    ![](images/project_version_git.png)
	    
	    1. Create Project

## Push: Edit and Commit

This time you'll make local changes by editing your local repository.  After saving the changes you'll *add* and *commit* the changes.  Lastly, you will *push* your changes up to the remote repoistory.

### Edit

1. In the Files Pane, Open the README.md file
1. In the Editor Pane, modify your README with [Markdown](markdown.html)

    - Make a Subheading with the word "Purpose":  `##Purpose`
    - A blank line, then "This is my first Git repository.  I'm going to push this file via RStudio"
1. Save the changes to this file
1. In the Git pane:

    1. Check each of the staged files
    1. Click *commit* and provide a message:  `this is my first edit of a README and supporting files`
    1. Click the *commit* button to engage your commit  process with the message, then close
    1. Click the *Push* arrow, then close, then close the commit dialogue box  
1. View your changes back at GitLab:  `https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/<<your-NetID>>/test-one`

## Pull

The next time you open your project in RStudio the first step you should take is to *Pull* from the GitLab repo.  Then make your changes, then commit and push.  If you forget to *Pull* you make have to resolve some conflicts so get into the habit of pulling before you make edits.

## Public or Private Repositories

- `https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/<<your-NetID>>/test-one` > Settings > Scroll to *Project Visibility* > right-hand drop-down list:  Private | Public
- Add a Description (Optional)
- Add Tags (Optional)  

## Public Hubs v Duke's Hub

- Public Hubs:  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

    - public by default
    - can pay for privacy
    - large user communities

- Duke's GitLab can make 

    - Works with your NetID
    - Same Functionality as above
    - Price is right
    - Can make any repo public, private by default
