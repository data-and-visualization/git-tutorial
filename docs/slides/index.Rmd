## Why RStudio?

- **Reproducibility** is a Top Priority

    - Seamless IDE integration between R & Git 
    - [Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) 

- **Git for Version Control**

    - Git can be a pain to configure but works well in the background
    - Leapfrog beyond the barrier of a painful configuration

- **RStudio orchestrates Git**

    - Alternative GUI Git Clients
    
        - [Sublime's Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)
        - GitKracken (if you have the [GitHub Student](https://education.github.com/pack) Pack)
        - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).  (defaults with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/))

# Reproducibility

class: middle
Karl Broman's *[initial steps toward reproducible research](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/)*

- Organize your data and code
- [Everything with a script](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/pages/scripts.html)
- Automate the process
- Turn scripts into reproducible reports
- Turn repeated code into functions
- Package functions for reuse
- Use version control
- License your software

## Broman: Everything with a script

The most basic aspect of **reproducible research** is that **everything you do** (convert data files, clean data, analyze data) should be **accomplished via code.** 

*Pointing and clicking, and copy-paste, are not reproducible.*

???

For Example...

1. Create Summary **Table in STATA**

2. **Copy** Table to MS **Excel**

3. **Format Table** for readability in Excel

4. Generate **Visualizations** in Excel

5. Integrate Excel Table into **Word > PDF**

Versioning can be used 

- as a kind of **breadcrumb system** that helps track the **research process/workflow**

- Using version control, one can **easily "roll back"** to an earlier moment in the research workflow.

- Leave a documented 

    - **trail of where you've been**
    - how you got there
    - generated as you go

### Source Code Mangement
By this I simply mean **version control on a personal level**.  Once can "branch" stages of research and merge successful operations.  In this way it becomes easier to keep track of the process and the progress.

### Tracking changes in **any file set**

**Git** can be used to **track any files**.

## Markdown

R Markdown -- when combined with various R packages -- makes R a flexible report generation system.  Thus R Notebooks become "literate code" where reports are an outcome of analysis.  If analysis changes at "run-time" reports can change as integrated parts of the whole.  

Notably:  **You Don't have to be a coder** to benefit from Version Control and R Markdown.  The two method/features can be used to compose all of your reporting needs, including MS Word, PDF, LaTex, WebPages, WebSites, Slides, e-books, etc.

I want to emphasize that *R* and *Git* are ideal for *reproducible research*.  However, the added factor of **R Markdown** -- when combined with various R packages -- makes R a flexible report generation system, arguably more *open* and *reproducible* than other proprietary collaborations systems.
