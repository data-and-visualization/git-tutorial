## Prerequisites

### Load & Install Software **Before the Workshop**

To complete the hands-on portion of the workshop you'll need software pre-installed.  Due to the nature of the workshop we will not have time to troubleshoot installations during the workshop.  Please be sure to perform the following steps **on the laptop you bring to the workshop**.  

### Required Software

#### Download and install  

I recommend accepting the install defaults for the following:

- **Git**: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>

    1. Download and install Git
    1. Run the install and accept all the defaults

- **R**: <a href="http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/"" target="_blank">http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/</a>

    - If you have not installed R before choose *install R for the first time*
    - If you already have R installed on your workstation I recommend running the latest version, but any reasonably current version should be fine.
    
- **RStudio**: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a>

If you haven't yet, install each of the above applications.  


### **Duke's** GitLab -- Verify *your NetID* Access

During the workshop we will use <a href="https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu" target="_blank">Duke's GitLab</a>.  To complete the hands-on portion of the workshop, you **must log-in** -- **in advance** of the workshop -- and ensure you have NetID access to <a href="https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu" target="_blank"> https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu</a>.  If you do not have access to **Duke's** GitLab, [contact OIT](https://oit.duke.edu/help).

- Be certain you log-in via "Duke Shibboleth Login" using your NetID

### Generate SSH keys in Advance of the Workshop

I recommend generating your SSH keys in advance of the workshop.  Then add your public key to Duke's GitLab.  To do so, you should have already installed Git to your laptop.  

Follow these instructions for generating and adding keys.  We will cover key configuration in the workshop although you will find the explanation easier to follow if you generate and add your keys in advance.

1. To begin, open a shell **from RStudio**

    - In RStudio > Menubar > `Tools > Shell...`

1. Follow the instructions <a href="https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/help/ssh/README" target="_blank">https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/help/ssh/README</a>

    - You can stop *after* step 5 of *[Generating a new SSH key pair](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair)*
1. Close the Shell
