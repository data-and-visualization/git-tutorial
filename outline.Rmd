## Prerequisites

Below are the details.  You must accomplish three steps **before attending the workshop**.

1. Install required software
1. Create your GitHub Account
1. Cache your GitHub Credentials

Details below.  

### Install Required Software **Before the Workshop**

To complete the hands-on portion of the workshop you'll need software pre-installed **on your laptop**.  Due to the nature of the workshop we will *not have time to troubleshoot installations during the workshop*.  Please be sure to perform the following steps **on the laptop you bring to the workshop**.  

**Download and install: Git, R, and RStudio** (in that order).  I recommend accepting the install defaults for the following applications:

#### Software Applications

- **Git**: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>

    - Windows:  

        1. <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Download</a> and install Git
        1. Run the install and accept all the defaults  (See Also:  More [details on Windows Git install](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows))
        
    - Mac:
    
        1. Open the [Terminal](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac)
        1. Run the following Comand -- AND if it prompts you to install Git, do so  
        
            - `git --version`  (See Also: More [details on Mac Install](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#macos))

- **R**: <a href="http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/"" target="_blank">http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/</a> (**latest version!!**)

    - If you have not installed R before, these [brief tutorial videos](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/00-setup/) are helpful.
    - Windows: choose *install R for the first time* (Windows) 
    - MacOS:  choose the *Latest release* package 

- **RStudio**: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a> 

<br><figure>![](images/rstudio_download.png)</figure><br>

If you haven't yet, install each of the above applications.  These [brief tutorial videos](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/00-setup/) are helpful if you're unsure of how to install R, RStudio or install R packages.

### Create GitHub Account and Verify Access
We will use  <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to create an initial public host for the repository you create during the workshop.  GitHub is free.  If you choose not to continue using GitHub, you can easily [delete the account](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-your-user-account/).     

1. Sign up for GitHub using the form on their front page:  https://github.com.  Use your Duke email address
1. ![](images/github_account2.png), Then Create the Account  


### Cache Credentials

The following are one-time configuration steps.  

#### HTTPS:  Configure R/RStudio to work with your Git/GitHub 

For most new Git users, the following steps are the most convenient and efficient for configuring your new applications for Git version control.  **If** you use **two-factor** authentication with **GitHub**, skip the the SSH section below.  The video clip can be used to clarify the written instructions below.

In your RStudio Console.... ([image](http://keziamanlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RStudioScreenshot1_Inkscape.png))

1. Install the `usethis` package:  `install.packages("usethis")`  
1. Load the `usethis` package:  `library(usethis)` 
1. In the RStudio **console**, configure `usethis`  You will **need to follow the instructions from within the console**, after invoking the `use_usethis` function:
    
    a. `use_usethis()`
    a. Restart R<p>
    
1. Configure your Git client with [your GitHub email address](https://github.com/settings/emails)

    a. `library(usethis)`
    a. `use_git_config(user.name = "<<github ID>>", user.email = "<<my github associated email address>>")`
    a. For example:  `use_git_config(user.name = "libjohn", user.email = "libjohn@duke.edu")`<p>
    

1. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and associate that token within your RStudio Environment (`.Renviron`).  Do this by running the following command **in the RStudio console** and following all the prompts.  When you run the command, below, this will spawn a GitHub Page that generates a PAT.  Copy the PAT into your clipboard buffer.  Paste the PAT into RStudio's editor window for the `.Renviron` file.  the PAT is your personal token; do not share it.  You can do all this by invoking the `browse_github_pat` function in the RStudio Console and following the resulting console prompts.  If you need more detail, see the [usethis Setup](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html) instructions.

    a. `browse_github_pat()`
    a. The RStudio Console will direct you how to `edit_r_environ()` in the RStudio Editor window
    a. Restart R


Let's assume you did everything correctly.  If you want to test it, try to **clone** a repository with the [following instructions](clone.html).  Now you're ready go to the [Hands-On](handson.html) section which we will cover in the workshop.

#### SSH:  Generate SSH keys

**Legacy Documentation Links**

If you followed the HTTPS section, above, **you do not need to also follow the links below**.  For those who use two-factor authentication at GitHub, I recommend SSH keys.  However, I no longer recommend SSH to Git newbies, because it's more complicated.  At the same time, the workshop procedures rely heavily on the [usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and may not work via SSH without more extensive configuration of the SSH keys.  Therefore, while it is possible to combine the `usethis` package with SSH keys, configuring this suite of applications and functions is beyond the scope of our workshop.  Nonetheless, I am leaving these *SSH Keys* instructions here as legacy information.  Feel free to **skip and ignore the following** links.

- [Generate SSH Keys](ssh_keys.html)
- [Create repository at GitHub and them Pull locaally](ssh_handson.html)
